 * @class GroverSearch
 * @brief Implements Grover's Search algorithm for unstructured search problems.
 * 
 * Grover's Search is a quantum algorithm designed to search through an unsorted database of size N in approximately âˆšN steps. 
 * This class provides an implementation of the Grover Search algorithm to search for a target element in a database, 
 * utilizing quantum superposition and amplitude amplification to increase the probability of finding the target.
 * 
 * This implementation assumes a binary database and uses a quantum circuit to perform the search, applying the Grover operator iteratively to amplify the amplitude of the target element.

     * 1. The **oracle** which marks the target element by flipping its sign.
     * 2. The **diffusion operator** which amplifies the probability of the target element by increasing the amplitude of the marked state.
     * The Grover operator is applied iteratively to increase the probability of finding the target element.
     * 
     * @param state A Boost vector representing the quantum state, which is a superposition of all possible states. The Grover operator acts on this state.
