covariance.csv
This file contains a synthetic covariance matrix for 10 financial assets. 
The matrix is structured such that the diagonal entries represent the variances of each asset's returns, 
while the off-diagonal entries indicate the covariances between different assets.

The covariance matrix is critical in portfolio optimization, allowing for the assessment of risk 
and correlation between assets in a portfolio.

Data Structure:
- Columns and Rows: Asset_1, Asset_2, ..., Asset_10
- Values: Covariance between assets (matrix of size 10x10)
