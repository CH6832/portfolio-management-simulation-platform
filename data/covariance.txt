covariance.csv
This file contains a synthetic covariance matrix for 10 financial assets. 
The covariance matrix is generated to be positive semi-definite, reflecting the variance and covariance relationships among the assets.

The matrix is structured such that the diagonal entries represent the variances of each asset's returns, 
while the off-diagonal entries indicate the covariances between different assets.

Data Structure:
- Columns and Rows: Asset_1, Asset_2, ..., Asset_10
- Values: Covariance between assets (positive semi-definite matrix)
