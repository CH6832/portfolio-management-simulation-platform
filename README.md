# Portfolio Management Simulation Platform

## Overview

The **Portfolio Management Simulation Platform** is a sophisticated tool for simulating and managing investment portfolios. It integrates both **classical finance models** and **quantum computing techniques** to offer a robust platform for portfolio construction, risk management, and scenario analysis. By using algorithms like the Markowitz model, Black-Litterman, Risk Parity, and incorporating quantum optimization methods such as QAOA, Grover's Search, and VQE, this platform provides an advanced simulation environment for testing and optimizing various investment strategies.

This project explores the intersection of **quantum computing** and **finance**, aiming to simulate and manage portfolios in an innovative and efficient way. It allows for scenario-based simulations, real-time data processing, and risk-adjusted portfolio tracking, enabling users to make data-driven investment decisions based on classical and quantum optimization methods.

## How It Works

### 1. **User Input**: 
   The user provides their portfolio parameters (e.g., asset allocation constraints, risk tolerance) and selects assets for simulation.

### 2. **Algorithm Selection**:
   Users can choose between **quantum** or **classical** optimization algorithms:
   - Quantum: QAOA, Grover’s Search, VQE, QSVM
   - Classical: Markowitz, Black-Litterman, Risk Parity, Monte Carlo simulations

### 3. **Simulation**:
   The platform runs simulations based on the selected algorithms and asset data, providing insights into the portfolio's performance, risks, and returns.

### 4. **Risk & Performance Metrics**:
   The platform calculates key metrics like **risk**, **return**, **Sharpe ratio**, **portfolio volatility**, and other advanced risk measures such as **VaR** (Value at Risk) and **CVaR** (Conditional Value at Risk).

### 5. **Visualization**:
   Results are visualized through interactive charts, including the **efficient frontier**, **portfolio allocations**, and detailed performance metrics.

### 6. **Scenario Analysis & Tracking**:
   Users can simulate how portfolios behave under different market scenarios, such as economic downturns or asset price shocks. They can track performance and adjust their portfolios over time.

## Usage Example

### Scenario 1: Classical Portfolio Simulation using the Markowitz Model

```json
{
  "algorithm": "Markowitz",
  "assets": ["AAPL", "GOOGL", "TSLA", "AMZN"],
  "constraints": {
    "risk": 0.1,
    "return": 0.12
  }
}
```

- **Result**: A portfolio optimized to balance risk and return with a specified target return of 12% and a maximum risk of 10%.

### Scenario 2: Quantum Portfolio Simulation using QAOA

```json
{
  "algorithm": "QAOA",
  "assets": ["AAPL", "GOOGL", "TSLA", "AMZN"],
  "constraints": {
    "risk": 0.08,
    "return": 0.15
  }
}
```

- **Result**: A quantum-optimized portfolio potentially offering a better risk-return tradeoff than classical algorithms for larger, more complex datasets.
