# Portfolio Management Simulation Platform

## Overview

The **Portfolio Management Simulation Platform** is a sophisticated tool for simulating and managing investment portfolios. Written in **C++**, it integrates **classical finance models** and **quantum computing techniques** to offer a robust platform for portfolio construction, risk management, and scenario analysis. By implementing algorithms such as the Markowitz model, Black-Litterman, Risk Parity, and incorporating quantum optimization techniques like QAOA, Grover's Search, and VQE, this platform provides an advanced simulation environment for optimizing and testing various investment strategies.

This project leverages the performance and scalability of C++ for financial simulations and data processing while supporting modular integration of quantum libraries such as Qiskit and PennyLane for cutting-edge optimization techniques.
